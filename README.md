# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Java

This repository contains simple Java programs demonstrating the four main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

- Encapsulation  
- Abstraction  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  

The purpose of this project is to understand how OOP concepts work in Java through practical examples.

## OOP Concepts Covered

### 1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit called a class.  
It restricts direct access to data by declaring variables as 'private' and providing access through public getter and setter methods.

### 2. Abstraction
Abstraction means hiding the internal implementation details and showing only essential features of an object.  
In Java, abstraction is achieved using:
- Abstract classes  
- Interfaces  

### 3. Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and methods of another class using the `extends` keyword.  
It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between parent and child classes.

### 4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms." It allows methods to behave differently based on the object.  
In Java, it is achieved through:
- Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)  
- Method Overriding (Run-time Polymorphism)
